#Identify goal/purpose
+Shift alphabet by a set number of letters based on the string and numerical input

#Specify each step
+Create `encode` function that accepts two parameters, `str` (string) and `num` (number)
+Declare a variable containing an empty string for returned output
+List acceptable characters to select from
+Iterate through list; define condition that determines what characters are selected based on input
···Shift each input letter(s) by the input number of spaces
+Verify the data type
+Populate output variable with encoded message
+Return encoded message

#Write code for each step
+__Shown in caesar_cipher.js file__

#Test code, identify errors
+Address each error one at a time
+Write them down

#Edit, retry
+Repeat until you exhaust the familiar options
+Potentially take brief break

#Research unfamiliar errors
+Specifically search for exact error message
+Evaluate for truth/relevance
+Test search results against written code

#Ask someone
+If stuck, reach out to a more experienced peer
