## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
Of the growth mindset article, the two points I found most resonant were recognizing the importance of making mistakes and not fearing asking for help; each relates to the other well.  It's easy to put a lot of unnecessary and unreasonable pressure on one's self to be infallible, especially in a challenging and pivotal endeavor such as this program.  It takes a not only strength, but humility to not see mistakes or asking a seemingly obvious question as a sign of ineptitude and instead view them as essential components of the learning process.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
Of the ways to demonstrate a growth mindset listed in the article, I feel most confident in knowing I have a belief that effort and practice will improve my skills.  Having trust in the process has given me patience and has calmed some of my fears of the "unknown".  The habit that I'm still working on is allowing myself to make mistakes and not consider them a reflection of my capabilities.  One of my goals for this program is to shift from that idea and reframe mistakes as steps toward future clarity and understanding.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
A food service mobile app for a restaurant like Chipotle likely uses arrays to list nearby locations to order from, ingredients to customize the user's meal, and possibly convenient pickup times.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An array method contains a block of code that can manipulate (i.e. removing, adding, or rearranging elements) or access and display information about an array.  These methods can be either destructive or non-destructive, meaning they can either permanently alter an array or they can return an altered copy of the array, thus keeping the original array in tact as originally written.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When would we use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
A loop's purpose is to quickly and thoroughly perform a specific task.  In conjunction with an array

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
If I were to explain the concept of loops to a 5-year-old, I would likely compare loops to birthday party invitations.  For every invitation the birthday person wants to send, they have to repeat the same tasks (often one card at a time) of writing in a name/location/time, placing each card in its own envelope, and placing it in the mail.  By the end, when there are no invitations left (the stopping condition), the job will be done.  A loop is a way to tell a computer to perform tasks like that for them automatically.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
What are some more examples of practical ways to use some of the more common array methods?
