## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

In using the Pomodoro technique the workflow felt more deliberate, effective, and less mentally taxing.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

Deciding in the beginning what task to work on helped me with prioritizing and focusing on specific concepts.  It's easy for me, when researching something, to start pulling on tangential threads and overwhelm myself with ideas that aren't exactly pertinent to the task that I'm working on at the time.  Clearly defining the objective at hand provides me with the boundaries I need and allows me to have faith that during the process, I'll cover much of the concepts I'll need to be successful in the future.  Regarding time estimation, I recognize that that will be an area that will require some strengthening for me.  I often read and re-read, which leads me to believe I take long than most to finish some tasks.  This will certainly be an aspect that I'll keep in consideration when organizing and working on tasks.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

Though both objects and arrays serve as containers of data, objects are used to model a complex, real-life thing with its own unique properties, while arrays are simply organized containers of items that share a commonality (though an array can contain objects as elements and objects can hold arrays as values to their properties).

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  ⋅⋅⋅An object would be better for this set of data as students can exhibit a state of being, possess many different attributes and can perform a variety of tasks.
  * List of states and their capitals
  ···If more information were required of these states (governor, population, state motto, etc), I would lean toward object, but seeing as this is only listing two specific details, I believe an array would be the better fit for this data set.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  ⋅⋅⋅An array would be best for this set of data, as these items cannot perform tasks on their own and their utility isn't necessarily dependent on their attributes.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  ···Though each profile may contain its own set of complex data, I believe that a list of simply the accounts would be better held in an array, seeing as the list has no inherit behaviors.
  * List of student names and their cohort
  ⋅⋅⋅Since the information is referring to only two, very specific things that can be conveyed in a string, I'd lean toward an array being more appropriate.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  ···An array would be more appropriate, because these items cannot perform independent actions and can more simply displayed as an organized list.
  * All my favorite restaurants
  ⋅⋅⋅An object would be more appropriate for this set of data as a potential customer would want to access many attributes about these restaurants (i.e. - cuisine, location, seat availability, etc.).

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

A web app I frequently use is YouTube, a video-sharing platform where users can view, upload, share, and otherwise interact with a wide variety of visual content.  I can envision each video page being an object that contains properties such as video size (numerical value in units of MB), number of views (numerical value), runtime (numerical value), comments (string value), and likes/dislikes (numerical value), among many others.  

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

How does the constructor function syntax compare to that of a factory function (pros/cons)?  Which is preferred?

I'm looking forward to discussing getters and setters and their roles in protecting and accessing private data.
