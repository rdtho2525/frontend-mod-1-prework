## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

The most resonant part of this article for me was habit number three: adopting a growth mindset.  I, like many others, at one time or another may have limited myself unknowingly by saying "I can't do that" or "I'm not that kind of person".  People are born in a fixed fashion, but are rather capable of growing, improving, and becoming the people they hope to become through methodical practice.  

Of the habits I already practice I have adopted the growth mindset, view learning as a process, practice healthy habits (most of the time), and take short breaks.  Through the course of this program, I aim to read more and practice teaching what I learn to others to improve my ability to process and retain new information.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

The data types I learned about in this section were strings, numbers, and booleans.  Strings are used to display text, numbers (in the form of either integers or floats, i.e. whole numbers and decimals) represent numerical value, and booleans represent either a true or false value.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

`console.log('Hello World');`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

To indicate comments, one would use '//' at the beginning of a statement or contain multiple lines of text in '/* */'.  Comments are used to provide context or any other additional information to better understand the purpose of a section of code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is a container of data that can be used to make code easier to read and understand.  If I were to explain the concept to a 5-year-old, I might compare variables to a pizza box (or any box with a label).  From the outside, we understand what the box represents and when we open it, it reveals the contents that we can actually use.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Three possible variables used by the app, Bandcamp, could be: a `bandName` (containing a string value), `runTime` (containing a numerical value), and isPlaying (containing a boolean value).

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is the joining together of data (often in the form of strings and variables) to create a sequence (i.e. a message).

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

In a Facebook notification, concatenation (or string interpolation) may be used to fill in details of a pre-written message communicating a common action (i.e. Sarah Johnson likes your photo, 'Sarah Johnson' and 'photo' possibly being interpolated variables).

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
Why does the temperate literal syntax (``${variable}``) use back ticks instead of quotation marks? (I'm sorry if this is a bit off topic)
