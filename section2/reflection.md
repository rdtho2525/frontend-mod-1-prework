## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

Like many, I've struggled with asking questions in the past.  Sometimes I still wait a little longer than I should before asking questions.  As described in one blog post, at one time or another, I've feared judgement or rejection for asking a
dumb question... so much so that I've cost myself time, knowledge, and opportunities.  Over the course of my professional life, I've learned the value of asking questions early and often (within reason, of course).  I can approach learning a new job or a new skill with the understanding that there is a lot to be learned and I won't always be able to grit and force my way into finding an answer.  I plan on asking plenty of "dumb" questions at Turing.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

Using outside resources can be tough sometimes.  Googling can often yield a wide range of results and it's challenging to parse through it all to see what I need.  I can find myself pulling at threads that aren't as relevant to what I'm presently doing.  However, some things can be easier to find than others.  For example, running code in the terminal: that research returned a fairly immediate result that was readily applicable.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement is one that uses a set of circumstances or behaviors to determine an outcome.  In daily life, if I'm hungry and I have food, I will eat.  In web application, it can be used to determine what code to display.  If a user hits the `like` button on an Instagram photo, it displays a notification to the user that posted the photo.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

To add multiple conditions to an `if` statement, use the else if/else keywords.  Their statements hold alternative outcomes based on varied conditions.  The script interpreter will look at each one and return the first one that holds a true value.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

Logical operators help a developer ensure that two or more conditions are met or if at least one of multiple conditions are met.  Those operators are, namely, the `AND` (&&, all conditions must be true) and `OR` (||, at least one condition must be true) operators.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

What are the pros/cons of using alternative syntaxes for conditional statements (ternary operators) and functions (concise body arrow functions)?
